# Image Processing with OpenCV
This repository contains a set of C++ files that demonstrate various image processing functionalities using the popular OpenCV library. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of image processing and provides code examples that can serve as a starting point for building your own applications.

## Files
1. **importing_images.cpp**: This file showcases how to import and paste images onto a canvas. It provides examples of loading images from different sources and placing them at specific locations.

2. **basic_function_opencv.cpp**: This file presents basic functions and dependencies of the OpenCV library. It includes code examples that demonstrate how to use fundamental library functions for image operations, such as reading, writing, format conversions, geometric transformations, and more.

3. **resize_and_crop.cpp**: This file contains examples of resizing and cropping images. It showcases various techniques and methods for scaling and cropping images using OpenCV.

4. **drawing_shapes_and_text.cpp**: This file demonstrates how to add text and draw shapes on existing images or blank canvases. It provides functions and methods for placing text, lines, geometric shapes, and more on images.

5. **warp_perspective.cpp**: This file includes code for perspective transformation of images or elements within an image. It offers functions for applying perspective transformations based on user-defined reference points.

6. **color_detection.cpp**: This file showcases how to detect colors of specific shapes using color parameters such as hue, saturation, and value. It also demonstrates how to process color values into numerical forms and create masks based on that information.

7.**shapes_and_contour_detection.cpp**
